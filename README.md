# Bitwise Operators in C++
This repository contains problems I solved while learning about bitwise operators in C++. Bitwise operations are essential in low-level programming and optimization tasks. By working through these problems, I deepened my understanding in c++

## Overview

The program performs several tasks using bitwise operators, such as:

- Combining solutions using bit masks.
- Testing and modifying individual bits.
- Performing logical operations like AND, OR, and shifts.
- Simulating genetic algorithm operations (mutation, crossover).
- Evaluating solutions based on a knapsack-like problem.
